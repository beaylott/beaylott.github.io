      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This is a public / personal space for myself online.</p>
      <p>
        I had a broken website on this domain for many years which was always a
        bit embarassing! 1d2f0.info was part of a md5 hash of an important file
        that I lost a long time ago. I chose .info because it is the gTLD
        created specifically for unrestricted use (arguably the other gTLD are
        <i>de facto</i> unrestricted).

        There are quite a few Ben[jamin] Aylott online including one who
        currently does quite a similar job to me! I'm the one that was born in
        Dorset, went to uni in Birmingham, and then lived in
        London/Sweden/Manchester. I studied theoretical physics at uni and after
        graduating 'dabbled' in academia and teaching ...but it wasn't for me.

        During uni I developed a strong interest in fighting climate change
        (amongst other things) and my next move was a masters in solar energy
        engineering. Off the back of that I spent six years working as a Systems
        Engineer for an energy services co-operative in Manchester called
        <a href="https://carbon.coop">Carbon Co-op</a> trying to make
        local/community energy systems a bit 'smarter'.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now work as a software engineer with a focus on 'devops', distributed
        systems, and data engineering.
